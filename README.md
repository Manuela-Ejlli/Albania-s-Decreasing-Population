Decreasing Population Rate in Albania — 2025 Analysis
This project analyzes Albania’s declining population with a focus on age groups, prefectures, and long-term demographic trends. All analysis, calculations, and visualizations were created in Microsoft Excel.

The dataset includes:
Total population by year
Population distribution by age groups
Population distribution by prefectures
Yearly and cumulative percentage changes
Graphs that illustrate demographic and regional shifts

Files Included
Decreasing Population Albania 2025.xlsx
This file contains:
Raw and cleaned population data
Age-group population tables
Prefecture-level population tables
Yearly totals and percentage-change formulas
Line charts, bar charts, and comparative graphs

Key Insights
Albania’s population shows a consistent long-term decline.
Younger age groups are shrinking faster than older groups, leading to an aging population structure.
Some prefectures show significantly higher population loss due to migration and urbanization patterns.
Visualizations highlight years with accelerated decline and notable demographic shifts.
